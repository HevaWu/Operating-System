# Schedule Algorithm Compare

Compare the CPU Schedule methods(FCFS, RR, SJF)

The simulation code is written by Visual Studio 2015, and use the C++ language.

folders contains the code of the question2.  
There is one cpu_schd.h, one Source.cpp in it.  
cpu_schd.h contains the initialization of progress and the scheduling algorithm code.  
Source.cpp contains the implement of the progress.  

You can use Visual Studio to run this code, thank you very much.
