#Bus Stop Mutex 

Each Bus will take passengers at each stop, we need to add a mutex signal to avoid deadlock.

This code is written by Visual Studio 2015. And it was composed by one Source.cpp and ont initialization.txt.

Source.cpp contains all the code which are related to this homework.
Initialization.txt contains the information of simulation, the five buses, 15 busstops, and so on.

You can use Visual Studio to run this code, thank you very much.
