# CPU Simulation

The simulation code is written by Visual Studio 2015, and use the C++ language.

Folders contains the code of question3.  
There is one cpu_run.h, one shedule_algorithm.h, and one simulation.cpp in it.  
cpu_run.h contains the initialization of progress.  
schedule_aogorithm.h contains the scheduling algorithm code.  
simulation.cpp contains the implement of the simulation.  
From the SJF simulation, my code might cause starvation, when a values less than 0.5.  
When it is not suggest, please restart the simulation again.   
Since the different random value, the simulation might suggest.  

You can use Visual Studio to run this code, thank you very much.
